## Functions

We have 2 major funtions in our application: 
1. ADD TRANSACTION
We can add transactions by filling in an amount(of a particular min and max) and category (only few specific categories)

2. ADD FILTER FOR TRANSACTIONS
We can filter these transactions based on either amount or category but specifying the amount under which we want the values or the category .

## Java Version
This code is compiled with ```openjdk 17.0.7 2023-04-18```. Please update your JDK accordingly if you face any incompatibility issue.
